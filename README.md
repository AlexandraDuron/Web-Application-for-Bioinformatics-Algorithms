# Web-Application-for-Molnet
A web application that encompasses the development of python code within Flask framework , the refactoring of the code of a software tool with object oriented design, the implementation of a process in the background,  image processing, and  the customization of a template.  I built this web application, for a program called Molnet. Molnet is a prototype for Molecular Networking. It was developed in the University of Glasgow, in The School of Computer Science by Dr. Simon Rogers. Specifically, this web application is aimed at supporting a section of Molnet, which optimizes parameters in Molecular Networking.
